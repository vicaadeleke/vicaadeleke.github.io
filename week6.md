Week 6 half way through the internship and it's been going smooth for me and my group. This week 
we have continued working in COMSOl with simplified geometry just creating different simulations 
with different release points, and different amounts of particle sprays. Tuesday we were working on our mid
project presentations, working on our speech and putting together the slides, Unfortunately we didn't get 
to present, but we went to the meeting where we were able to listen to other groups and what challenges they
were facing through their projects. Luckily me and my group don't have much problems that the other teams were
facing. Can't wait to see what the upcoming weeks have for me and my team.
