This week I was assigned to Project 1 Reduced order model development with machine
learning to simulate drug delivery in nasal cavity, For the first couple of days we were
learning how to use 2 softwares, COSMOl, and Meshmixer. For COMSOL is where we looked at 2D and 3D
Laminar Static Mixers and for Meshmixer we can create and modify 3D models. So in our project we
will be using this to look at different models of peoples noses, So we can see the air passage way
to determine how effective the nasal medication delivery was. We discovered that since every person has a different nose
size not all nasal spray medications will have the same effective rate. Some won't work at all.
