This week we started off by taking the modified models of the simplefied nose and we were tasked to run each simulation through COMSOL software. We were running into different types of errors running these models that
we didn't completely understand. So for some of the models we had to change around the detection of the mesh and seeing if it could compute the correct way. So mostly trial and error. The next working day our mentor lets us 
know that the timing of the simulation was off so we had to go through all 64 models again. But this time we were going through less errors. Later on in the week we start training our Machine Learning model in mathlab. Graduate mentor 
was showing us how to do that. And we continued to work on our final presentation.
