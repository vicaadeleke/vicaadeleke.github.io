This week we started off looking into different articles that relate to our project, we tried moving forward in our simulations
but now the model we created isn't working right, after our mentor has been adding different settings to our model, it crashed.
We are working towards getting it back up and running. Next day we started preparing for our mid summer presentations. Dr. Anita Pandey stopped 
by and gave us advice on which research paper we could use which and which one was reliable. Next day we had our presentations, I was a little nervous at first
and during the presentation but i'd say it went smoothly. The presentation we did felt a little shorter than 15 minutes but atleast we got through it. 
For the rest of the week we were trying to get our model back up and running so we can get the dataset that we need to use the machine learning.
