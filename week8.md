This week we started off working in SOLIDWORKS where we were able to change different variables within the simplified
nose model. We had to create 64 different models. we split it up with our group. We came up with a system where we used ChatGPT 
to generate different sequence of numbers 1-4 so that we could come up with a random combination that allowed us to change our model.
After taking all 64 models we went back into comsol where we would run the simulation to see how the particles would flow with the 
difference in the shape that we made. From this we were able to get a dataset to show us the outcome of the particles. Later on in the week
we worked on our elevator pitch. It was alright. Could've done better after the skit with the energy. And then even more later in the week
I met up with Dr. Pandey to get some help with the research paper.
