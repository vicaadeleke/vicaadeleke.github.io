This week in our project we were finally able to work with CT scans from University of North Carolina
we are now able to simulate the nasal spray by using particles to put through the nasal cavity. We are able to
change the pressure point, the angle, and direction that the particles spray. A stuggle that I faced was when using the
software we are challenged with not letting that particle point touch any part of the nose. It's a tight squeeze but we were able
to find the perfect point to put it. On Thursday this week we visited NASA Goddard Space Flight Center where we took a look
at different instruments that they used the measure climate change. I found the segmenmt where we on the roof most interesting 
because we were able to see the mechanics and the instruments were moving on their own.
