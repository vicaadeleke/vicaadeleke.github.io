This week I was able to meet up with Dr. Peng, as well as my graduate mentor and my other group member, 
During this meeting we were able to discuss our project and get a little more insight on what we were going 
to be accomplishing. A couple findings i've made is how I need to sharpen my skills on Python so I can be successful
during this internship. The algorithm that I used this week was Logistic Regression with machine learning which is a statistical
method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear
equation to the observed data. This week I didn't run into much issues, it has been a good eye opener on things that I need
to brush up on and study more about.
