This week we started off doing the same as last, working in comsol software messing around with the parameters, in the 
CT scans from Univeristy of North Carolina, Later in the week, our mentor Lou was able to create a simplified 
geometry model of the nose where we messed around with it trying to get it to function. Also got ready for the high schoolers
presentation. On thursday we had a middle of the project meeting, discussing how the next coming weeks we will be moving
forward. After a lot of troubleshooting friday we were able to get the simplified geometry computed.
