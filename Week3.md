This week in our project we accomplished testing out different geometries and changing the parameters to get different
results in the 3D software COMSOL. We were able to see the changes in the particle spray when we adjusted the amount of spray 
and the point that it came from. Also changing the geometry would show different results. Some struggles we had were navigating 
around the software but that is about it. Also went to John Hopkins this week where we saw a bunch of cool technology. I found the image generating A.I intersting as well as the robotic dog APLSTRUDEL. Would definitely love to visit back over there.
