Week 10 last and final week. Can't believe it's over already. Started the first week just learning the basics of python now we are here working on our final presentation.
At the start of this week we started with the data collection so we can get the results. Once we simulated all of the models we put the data into mathlab where our mentor worked on the 
coding. I just worked on the power point making sure everything was ready for the symmposium. When we finally presented it wasn't the best performance from our group. I feel like we were'nt 
too prepared since our mentor had stuff added last second. Didn't have much time to understand it. Had a better presentation at the mid summer one. Thank God it's over though.
